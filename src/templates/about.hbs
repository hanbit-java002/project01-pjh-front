					<li>About Us</li>
					<li><p>We are MADE Publishers, a boutique periodical and book publisher with offices in Melbourne (Australia) and New York (United States). Founded in 2007 by partners Thomas Williams and Amber Hourigan we produce editions and books dedicated to design, photography, fashion, art, architecture, health & lifestyle. With an emphasis on quality content and high production values, our publications have been recognized internationally with various awards and accolades.</p>

						<p>Whilst we are committed to producing the highest quality printed publications, we also embrace new technologies and continue to explore the increasingly growing sector of digital publishing. Adopting a ‘hybrid’ publishing philosophy, we believe that both print and digital can exist in harmony, often enhancing and complementing one another in unexpected ways.</p></li>

					<li>Stockist & Distribution</li>
					<li><p>Our publications are stocked at independent retailers, bookstores and galleries around the world. Unlike traditional distribution models, we liaise directly with all of our stockists, and dispatch our stock directly from our warehouse and fulfillment centre in Berlin, Germany. We prefer to deal directly with our stockists, which enables us to offer a greater margin for our retailers and to ensure that all stock arrives safely and on-time. We offer generous wholesale pricing and have a range of competitive shipping options available worldwide.</p>

						<p>If you have a store and would like to stock our publications, or know of one that might be a good fit, we’d love to hear from you! For a complete information kit and wholesale pricing, please email us at orders@madepublishers.com</p></li>
